# Mayo-Clinic---STRIP-AI

## Description

* Code for Kaggle competition.
* The code is used to classify the stroke blood clot origin.

### <b>As one can read from the Kaggle description:</b>

The dataset for this competition comprises over a thousand high-resolution whole-slide digital pathology images. Each slide depicts a blood clot from a patient that had experienced an acute ischemic stroke.
The slides comprising the training and test sets depict clots with an etiology (that is, origin) known to be either CE (Cardioembolic) or LAA (Large Artery Atherosclerosis). We include a set of supplemental slides with either an unknown etiology or an etiology other than CE or LAA.
Your task is to classify the etiology (CE or LAA) of the slides in the test set for each patient.
